# Hoya-Hacks-Website-Code
This repo contains the whole website code. This project to be submitted to Hoya Hacks 2021 Gerogetown University premier Hackathon. 

Description - This website explains about our Data Visualization project which we made along with this and tell who are the people behind these projects. So this website was made using simple Html, Css, Javascript but to make it more functionable, responsive and beautiful I used Slick.js, bootstrap, some External CDN's and Fontawesome.com. 

To try out this website there are two custmized links -: :) :} :]
